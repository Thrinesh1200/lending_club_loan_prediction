# Lending Club Loan Prediction
### We will be using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

### The special version of the file with some extra features is given by Pierian Data Inc. This data set is used other than original for the project and copyrights to Pierian Data Inc.

## Background

LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.[3] It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

## Goal

Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), can we build a model that can predict whether or not a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.
